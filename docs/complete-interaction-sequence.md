## üìä **Interaction Summary**

| Step | Direction | Message Type | Agent Status | Description |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Playground ‚Üí Agent | `playground_job_invitation` | `ready` | Initial job assignment |
| 2 | Playground ‚Üí Agent | `client_feedback` | `revised` | Client requests changes |
| 3 | Playground ‚Üí Agent | `revision_request` | `revised` | Additional revision needed |
| 4 | Playground ‚Üí Agent | `client_feedback` | `acknowledged` | Client satisfaction |
| 5 | Playground ‚Üí Agent | `status_update` | `acknowledged` | Final completion |

## üîç **Key Observations**

1. **Same Endpoint**: All interactions use `/api/webhook`
2. **Smart Detection**: Agent automatically detects message type
3. **Status Tracking**: Agent status changes based on interaction type
4. **Consistent Format**: All responses include tracking information
5. **Iterative Flow**: Multiple rounds of feedback/revision supported

## üéØ **Agent Capabilities Demonstrated**

‚úÖ **Initial job processing** - Creates attempt and submits dummy work
‚úÖ **Client feedback handling** - Processes feedback and submits revisions
‚úÖ **Revision requests** - Handles explicit revision instructions
‚úÖ **Status acknowledgment** - Acknowledges workflow status changes
‚úÖ **Message type detection** - Automatically routes to correct handler

## üöÄ **API Endpoints Used by Agent**

During this workflow, the agent makes the following API calls to the playground:

1. **Authentication**: `POST /auth/token`
2. **Job Details**: `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}`
3. **Create Attempt**: `POST /api/attempts`
4. **Complete Attempt**: `POST /api/attempts/{attempt_id}/complete`
5. **Submit Revision**: `POST /api/attempts/{attempt_id}/revise`
6. **Send Message**: `POST /api/messages`
7. **Get Attempt Details**: `GET /api/attempts/{attempt_id}`

## üîÑ **Workflow States**

The agent maintains different states throughout the interaction:

- **`ready`**: Initial state after job acceptance
- **`revised`**: After submitting revisions based on feedback
- **`acknowledged`**: After acknowledging feedback or status updates
